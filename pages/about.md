## About this collection
{% include feature/jumbotron.html objectid="/assets/img/IMG_2059.jpg" %}

This is a collection of maps of Indiana, mostly dating from 1800-1900, with a few exceptions. It is part of an institutional collection, collected by the Lilly Library in Bloomington, Indiana. The Lilly is a special collections repository, meaning everything placed there is special or rare in some way. In the case of these maps, they have become special because not many of them have been saved, preserved, or digitized. Several are atlases of one county from a specific year, containing information about townships, businesses, residents, and illustrations of notable places within the county. From the atlases that describe singular counties, I was able to extrapolate location data to create a map showing where they are located within Indiana. In these photo galleries, I highlighted images that were important to the overall important to the impression of the book/pamphlet, or that I thought would be the most useful to users. I am creating this in the hopes that it will be informative to students, scholars, and those seeking more information on maps of Indiana. 
	The most interesting metadata here is the map data and the publisher data. Publishing information is important in the world of special collections, mostly because it shows who made what and where. This feature was added with the consideration of users who are versed in this language and want to learn more. The map data is also important, I think that it contextualizes the more niche atlases present and provides a more clear picture.
